Â¡Build your own collaboration app in seconds with Helpbuttons! 

This software helps you to build collaborative tools for any activity, such as sharing transport or seizing food. It connects people with specific needs to create networks. Mutual support groups, neighborhood communities, schools, town halls or emergency teams would be great benefit from it.

We're currently testing real life examples that you can check in our website. Specially we're aiming to maximize accesibility and develop modules that allow more use cases. Check those tags if you want to help us in those fields.

You can install your own tool in your server with this repo or ask us for help and host it at <a rel="me" href="https://helpbuttons.org">helputtons.org</a>

#### Troubleshooting the api

- Accessing the database to docker:

`$ docker-compose exec db psql -U [USER] [DATABASE_NAME]`

- When the backend fails to start because of database problems, you can always reset the database, by removing the directory `db`

- If you need to drop the scheme and restart fresh you run
`$ yarn schema:drop` or `$ docker-compose exec api yarn schema:drop`
