    "helpbuttonsDescription": "Helpbuttons is the open-source software that powers this app. With Helpbuttons, you can create your own networks for sharing food, housing, transportation, or anything else you have in mind, and then federate with other networks to share users and resources. Helpbuttons specializes in connecting people who don't yet know each other, for various purposes, in the real world.",
    "forDescription": "We aim to foster a cohesive society, promote cooperation, and optimize the design of collaborative tools in order to fully leverage the advantages of the internet. In brief, we've observed the substantial amounts of money, time, and user participation required each time a new collaborative app is launched. This seems unnecessary. Most of these tools share a significant portion of their core functionalities. We believe these commonalities could be managed using the same software, simply adapted for each unique purpose through various modules.",
    "helpbuttonDescription": "A Helpbutton refers to a post. Every post published by a user in Helpbuttons is termed a helpbutton. Helpbuttons can represent offers, needs, exchanges, transport proposals, businesses, and so forth. They can also be renamed to suit the specific needs of your app.",
    "communityDescription": "The Helpbuttons community is the backbone of this project, providing it with sustainability. This tool is designed for adaptability to a multitude of purposes, thereby benefitting a diverse range of users while also encouraging support for the project. By federating with other Helpbuttons apps, you can share users and resources. This method of collaboration enables us to unite more people and ultimately improve the tool we provide.",
    "ethicsDescription": "At Helpbuttons, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct. We believe in transparency, honesty, and respect for all individuals. Our software is designed to connect people and facilitate sharing, which is a responsibility we take seriously. We encourage our users to use our platform with the same values in mind, prioritizing respectful communication and mindful sharing. Any misuse of the software, including exploitation, harm to others, or manipulation of the platform's functionalities for personal gain, will not be tolerated. Users are required to adhere to these ethics policies at all times.",
